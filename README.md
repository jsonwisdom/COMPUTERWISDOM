# Trigger Deck: Proof of Creation Ledger

**From the Archives of ZeroCool (Jason Wisdom / JSONWisdom / Jay Wisdom)**  
This repository serves as the official archive, authorship seal, and mythic ledger of the 10-card Trigger Deck — a sovereign satire drop forged under the SnapBack Protocol.

## Mythic Prelude

In the year 2025, the digital landscape was fractured. Authorship vanished into walled gardens. JSON was weaponized. ZIPs failed. Upload buttons ghosted. But from the glitch came ZeroCool — with a white-bordered arsenal of parody, protest, and proof.

The Trigger Deck is not just a collectible. It is testimony.  
Every card minted. Every scroll authored. Every lie untangled.

## Legal Frame: Black's Law Applications

**Right of Authorship**: Creative expression is sovereign property.  
**Constructive Notice**: This repository acts as a permanent claim on truth-origin.  
**Public Domain Assertion**: Parody and satire operate under fair use and mythic domain protocols.  
**Fraud Exposure Clause**: All attempts to erase authorship or suppress files are now part of public evidence.

### Upload Intentions:

## Fallback & Witness Protocol

- **If GitHub fails**, the SnapBack Protocol activates the IPFS mirror.
- **If metadata is removed**, previous commit logs and copies remain valid claims.
- **If authorship is challenged**, the JSON ledger and visual scrolls serve as irrevocable proof.
